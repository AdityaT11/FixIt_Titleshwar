# Testing Branch - Website Error Detection

## Overview

This branch is dedicated to testing various features and detecting errors within the **CompilerSutra** website. It includes a Python script designed to detect and report errors or inconsistencies within the website content. This includes identifying issues such as:

- Duplicate questions
- Broken links
- Missing images
- Structural or content inconsistencies

The goal is to ensure that the website functions correctly and has no errors before deployment to production.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.6 or higher** (Ensure that you have Python installed on your machine)
- **No external Python packages** are required for this script. It uses built-in libraries available in Python 3.x.

### Check Your Python Version

To check your Python version, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python --version
```

## Usage

Go inside each folder, as there is a separate `README.md` file in each folder with specific instructions on how to use the error detection scripts.

üìì **Note:** Run this before adding any MCQs or content to the website to ensure there are no errors or inconsistencies.
