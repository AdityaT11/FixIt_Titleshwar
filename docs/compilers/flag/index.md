# ðŸš© Compiler Flags

Compiler flags control various aspects of how code is compiled. This section covers optimization, debugging, and architecture-specific flags, giving you fine-grained control over the compilation process.

## Topics

- Optimization flags for performance tuning
- Debugging and profiling flags
- Architecture-specific flags for cross-compilation
