# üõ†Ô∏è Compiler Front End

The front end of a compiler is responsible for analyzing source code syntax and generating an intermediate representation. This section explores lexical analysis, parsing, and Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) generation.

## Topics

- Lexical analysis and tokenization
- Syntax and semantic analysis
- Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) construction
