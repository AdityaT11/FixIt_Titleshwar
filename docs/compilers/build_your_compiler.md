## Build Your First Compiler with LLVM in 100 Lines

Have you ever wondered how powerful compilers like **Clang** and **GCC** transform source code into machine-readable instructions? What magic happens under the hood to turn human-readable code into optimized binaries?

In this hands-on tutorial, we'll demystify the process by building a **toy arithmetic compiler** using **LLVM's C++ API** ‚Äî all in just **100 lines of code**. No need for a complex parser or frontend; we'll focus purely on **LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR)** generation, which is the heart of most modern compilers.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll gain practical experience with:

- **LLVM IR Generation**: Understand the key concepts of LLVM's intermediate code.
- **Creating Functions and Basic Blocks**: Learn how to structure your compiler's logic.
- **Working with LLVM Tools**: Use LLVM's suite of tools to generate, inspect, and execute your code.

<details>
<summary> IR Hierarchy Summary (Code ‚Üí IR)</summary>

### Program
- **Definition**: Represents the entire codebase of a program, typically corresponding to the compiled version of a project.
- **Example**: A compiled executable or library, such as `main.exe` (in C/C++), or `a.out`, which is the final output of the compilation process.
- **Details**: 
  - The program is the highest abstraction level in the IR hierarchy.
  - It contains multiple modules that were compiled together to form the final application or library.

---

### Module
- **Definition**: Represents a single source file or unit of code. In most cases, it corresponds to a specific file in the project.
- **Example**: `math.cpp`, `utils.f90`, `main.c`, or `program.asm`.
- **Details**:
  - A module typically contains one or more functions, classes, or subroutines that form the logical building blocks of the program.
  - Modules are independent in their compilation but can reference or interact with other modules through external links or imports.

---

## Function
- **Definition**: A function is a named block of code that performs a specific task. It is the basic unit of computation in most programs.
- **Example**: 
  ```cpp
  int add(int a, int b) { 
      return a + b; 
  }
- **Details**:
    - A **function consists** of a name, parameters, a body, and sometimes a return type
    - During compilation, the function is translated into a series of intermediate representations that describe the computations and control flow of the function
    - Functions can be broken down into multiple basic blocks to facilitate optimizations and transformations.
---

## Basic Block
- **Definition**: A basic block is a sequence of instructions where control flows linearly without any jumps or branches, except at the end.
- **Example**: The body of a loop, the condition in an if statement, or a simple sequence of operations within a function.
- **Details**:
  - Each basic block ends with either a jump (conditional or unconditional) or a function return.
  - Control flow between basic blocks is analyzed to identify possible optimization opportunities (e.g., loop unrolling, instruction reordering).
  - The **entry point** of a basic block is the first instruction, and the **exit point** is the last instruction.

---

## Instruction
- **Definition**: An instruction is a single low-level operation that is typically a machine operation or an assembly-like operation.

- **Example**:
  ```llvm
  %1 = add i32 %2, %3
  ```
- **Details**:
    - ***Opcode*** : This represents the action or operation to be performed (e.g., add, mul, sub, load, store, jmp).
    
    - ***Operands***: The variables or constants on which the instruction operates. These could be registers, memory addresses, or immediate values.
    
    - Instructions can be atomic operations like arithmetic, logical, memory load/store, or control flow operations.
    
    - Each instruction in the IR serves as a step in simulating the computation or data transformation described by the higher-level program.

### Relationships Between Each Level
- **Program ‚Üí Module**: A program consists of multiple modules. Each module typically corresponds to a source file and is independently compiled.

- **Module ‚Üí Function**: Each module contains one or more functions, which represent logical units of work (e.g., computation or IO operations).

- **Function ‚Üí Basic Block**: Functions are broken into basic blocks, representing smaller pieces of code that execute sequentially.

- **Basic Block ‚Üí Instruction**: Basic blocks are composed of instructions, which represent individual low-level operations.

## main.cpp ‚Äî The Compiler Code

In these section we will see what actually we need to do. We are using a LLVM API the goal of these api is to:
1. **Generate LLVM IR**: We will generate the LLVM IR from the source code.
2. **View the IR**: We will check the IR generated to understand its structure.
3. **Run IR**: We will execute the IR using the LLVM interpreter (`lli`).
4. **Compile the IR**: We'll convert the IR to an object file.
5. **Link the Object File**: We'll link the object file to create an executable.
6. **Run the Program**: Finally, we'll run the executable and see the result.

```cpp
#include "llvm/IR/IRBuilder.h"
#include "llvm/IR/LLVMContext.h"
#include "llvm/IR/Module.h"
#include "llvm/IR/Verifier.h"

using namespace llvm;

int main() {
  LLVMContext Context;
  Module *TheModule = new Module("toy", Context);
  IRBuilder<> Builder(Context);

  // Create printf declaration
  FunctionType *PrintfType = FunctionType::get(
      IntegerType::getInt32Ty(Context), PointerType::get(Type::getInt8Ty(Context), 0), true);
  FunctionCallee PrintfFunc = TheModule->getOrInsertFunction("printf", PrintfType);

  // Create main function: int main()
  FunctionType *FT = FunctionType::get(Type::getInt32Ty(Context), false);
  Function *MainFunc = Function::Create(FT, Function::ExternalLinkage, "main", TheModule);

  // Create entry block
  BasicBlock *BB = BasicBlock::Create(Context, "entry", MainFunc);
  Builder.SetInsertPoint(BB);

  // Build expression: (3 + 4) * (2 - 1)
  Value *L = Builder.CreateAdd(ConstantInt::get(Context, APInt(32, 3)),
                               ConstantInt::get(Context, APInt(32, 4)));
  Value *R = Builder.CreateSub(ConstantInt::get(Context, APInt(32, 2)),
                               ConstantInt::get(Context, APInt(32, 1)));
  Value *Res = Builder.CreateMul(L, R);

  // Create a global format string: "%d\n"
  Value *FormatStr = Builder.CreateGlobalStringPtr("%d\n");

  // Call printf
  Builder.CreateCall(PrintfFunc, {FormatStr, Res});

  // Return 0 from main
  Builder.CreateRet(ConstantInt::get(Context, APInt(32, 0)));

  // Validate & print IR
  verifyFunction(*MainFunc);
  TheModule->print(outs(), nullptr);
  return 0;
}

```

LLVM APIs helped by:
- Managing memory and constants with `LLVMContext`.
- Structuring the program with `Module`.
- Creating IR instructions easily with `IRBuilder`.
- Declaring and calling external functions like `printf`.
- Validating the IR using `verifyFunction`.
- Outputting the generated IR with `TheModule->print`.

## What You Just Built

### 1. LLVM Module with a `main()` Function
We started by creating an LLVM module named `"toy"` using `LLVMContext` and `Module`.  
A `main()` function of type `i32()` was defined using `FunctionType` and `Function`.

This setup forms the foundational structure of any LLVM-based program.

---

### 2. Arithmetic Expression: `(3 + 4) * (2 - 1)`
We constructed an arithmetic expression manually using LLVM‚Äôs `IRBuilder`.  
Each part of the expression was built using LLVM instructions:
- `CreateAdd` for `3 + 4`
- `CreateSub` for `2 - 1`
- `CreateMul` for multiplying the results

This demonstrates LLVM's ability to model mathematical operations.

---

### 3. LLVM IR Generation
After constructing the logic, the IR was verified using `verifyFunction()` to ensure correctness.  
The IR was printed to standard output using `TheModule->print(...)`.

This IR is human-readable and forms a low-level, typed representation of the program.

---

### 4. Compiled to Object Code and Executable
Using the LLVM toolchain:
- `llc` was used to compile the `.ll` file into an object file (`.o`)
- `clang` was used to link the object file into an executable

This shows how to take generated IR and produce a working native binary.

## FAQ
:::note 
<details>
<summary> FAQ </summary>

### Q: What is LLVM?
LLVM is a collection of modular and reusable compiler and toolchain technologies, used for code generation, optimization, and more. It is widely used for building compiler backends, code analysis tools, and runtime environments.

### Q: What is Clang?
Clang is a compiler front-end for the C, C++, and Objective-C programming languages, built as part of the LLVM project. It provides diagnostics and optimization for code and is known for its fast compilation speed and high-quality error messages.

### Q: What does `llvm-config` do?
`llvm-config` is a helper tool that prints the compile and link flags required to use LLVM libraries. It's often used to obtain necessary information about LLVM's installed components and to configure build systems.

### Q: Can I use LLVM on Windows?
Yes, LLVM can be used on Windows. We recommend using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) for a Linux-like environment, or alternatively, you can use MSVC (Microsoft Visual C++) to integrate LLVM on Windows.

### Q: Where should I go next after learning LLVM basics?
Once you have a basic understanding of LLVM, you can dive deeper into building compilers, working with the LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR), or integrating MLIR (Multi-Level Intermediate Representation) for domain-specific compilers.

### Q: How do I set up LLVM for my project?
To set up LLVM, you need to install the LLVM toolchain and ensure that the necessary paths are configured in your build system. Detailed installation instructions can be found on the LLVM website for various operating systems.

### Q: How does LLVM optimize code?
LLVM applies a series of optimization passes on the Intermediate Representation (IR) to improve performance, reduce code size, and enhance other aspects of the code. These optimizations include dead code elimination, constant propagation, loop unrolling, and others.

### Q: What are LLVM IR and its use cases?
LLVM IR is a low-level programming language used by LLVM to represent programs during compilation. It is a platform-independent intermediate representation that allows for various optimizations and code generation across different architectures.

### Q: How does Clang compare to GCC?
Clang and GCC are both compiler front-ends, but Clang is known for producing more user-friendly error messages, faster compilation times, and better integration with modern development tools. GCC, on the other hand, has been around longer and offers better support for certain languages and features.

### Q: How do I integrate LLVM into my own project?
To integrate LLVM into your project, you can use its libraries to build custom tools like compilers, static analyzers, or optimizers. LLVM's modularity makes it easy to pick and choose the components you need.

### Q: Can I use LLVM for just optimization without a full compiler setup?
Yes, LLVM provides powerful optimization passes that can be used independently of the full compiler setup. You can use it to optimize specific pieces of code or data structures in your applications.
