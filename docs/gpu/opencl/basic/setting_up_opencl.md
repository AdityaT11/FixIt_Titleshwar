OpenCL **(Open Computing Language)** is an open standard for ``parallel programming of heterogeneous systems``, enabling developers to write portable code that runs efficiently on a wide variety of devices such as ``CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and other accelerators``.

Whether you're working on high-performance computing (HPC), machine learning, real-time graphics, or embedded systems, OpenCL provides a unified framework for harnessing the power of parallelism.

:::cautions
This guide is designed to help you set up ```OpenCL across Linux, macOS, and Windows`` platforms, ensuring you're ready to build and run OpenCL programs on your hardware```. We'll walk you through the installation process, demonstrate ```how to verify your setup```, and provide a hands-on example of an OpenCL program. Additionally, we’ll address common pitfalls and provide resources for further learning.
:::

Whether you're a developer exploring GPU acceleration for the first time, a researcher optimizing algorithms for high-throughput systems, or an engineer working on AI workloads, this guide will give you the solid foundation you need to get started with OpenCL.

<details>
<summary> Digram Explanation  </summary>

To set up OpenCL on your system, start by identifying your hardware platform — whether it’s an **Intel**, **AMD**, or **NVIDIA** GPU, or a **CPU**. First, install the `pciutils` tool to detect available OpenCL platforms and devices.
<details>
<summary> On Mac Use </summary>
```bash
 system_profiler SPDisplaysDataType
 ```
 Output
 ```bash
Graphics/Displays:

    Apple M1 Pro:

      Chipset Model: Apple M1 Pro
      Type: GPU
      Bus: Built-In
      Total Number of Cores: 16
      Vendor: Apple (0x106b)
      Metal Support: Metal 3
      Displays:
        Color LCD:
          Display Type: Built-in Liquid Retina XDR Display
          Resolution: 3024 x 1964 Retina
          Main Display: Yes
          Mirror: Off
          Online: Yes
          Automatically Adjust Brightness: Yes
          Connection Type: Internal

 ```
</details>

 Running `lspci` helps you check which GPU vendor is detected on your system, guiding your next steps.

 :::note
 On linux use 
 ```bash
 lspci | grep -i vga
 ```
 output
 ```bash
 00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Iris Plus Graphics G7 (rev 07)

  ```
  > As per output your GPU vendor is Intel
 :::

Based on the detected vendor, install the corresponding OpenCL SDK or driver:  
- For **Intel**, install the **Intel OpenCL SDK** (supports CPUs and Intel GPUs).  
- For **AMD**, install the **AMD ROCm** platform for GPU support.  
- For **NVIDIA**, install the **NVIDIA driver** along with the **CUDA toolkit**, which includes OpenCL support.  
- For CPU-only setups, ensure the CPU OpenCL runtime is installed, often included in Intel’s SDK or system packages.

Next, install the **`ocl-icd-opencl-dev`** package (or equivalent) to provide the OpenCL Installable Client Driver (ICD) loader. This allows multiple OpenCL implementations to coexist smoothly on the system.

After installation, run `clinfo` again to verify that the OpenCL platform and devices are properly recognized and available. Finally, write, compile, and run a simple OpenCL program (e.g., vector addition) to confirm your environment works as expected.

---

:::tips  
- Always check `clinfo` output carefully for the presence and status of OpenCL platforms and devices.  
- Keep GPU drivers up to date to avoid compatibility issues.  
- Use vendor-specific SDK documentation for troubleshooting and optimization tips.  
- When developing OpenCL programs, start with simple examples to verify your setup before moving to complex kernels.  
- On Linux, the ICD loader (`ocl-icd-opencl-dev`) is crucial for handling multiple vendors' OpenCL implementations without conflict.

This process ensures a smooth setup for OpenCL development across Intel, AMD, NVIDIA GPUs, and CPUs.

   <summary> Step-by-step Setup Guide </summary>

    1. **Detect your GPU and OpenCL Platforms**
    ```bash
        lspci | grep -i vga
    ```
    Use this command to list installed OpenCL platforms and devices.

    2. **Check GPU Vendor**  
    Identify if your system has Intel, AMD, NVIDIA, or CPU OpenCL support.

    3. **Select your Vendor and Install the Corresponding OpenCL SDK:**

    - **Intel:**
      - Install Intel OpenCL Runtime/SDK from [Intel’s official site](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/opencl-sdk.html)
      - For Intel CPUs/GPUs, install the Intel OpenCL CPU runtime package.

    - **AMD:**
      - Install AMD ROCm or AMD APP SDK from [AMD's ROCm website](https://rocmdocs.amd.com/en/latest/)
      - For Windows, AMD's drivers include OpenCL support.

### Step 1: Verify Your Vendor System

Install `psutils` to check which OpenCL platforms and devices are available:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install psutils
lspci | grep -i vga
```

This will show a list of OpenCL-capable devices. Identify whether your system has an Intel, AMD, or NVIDIA GPU, or if you're using CPU-only support.

<TabItem value="intel" label="Intel">

### Intel GPU Support

Install required packages:

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential libclang-dev libopencl1
```

Then download and install the Intel OpenCL SDK or runtime:

[Visit Intel OpenCL SDK](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/oneapi/installation-guide-linux/2023-1/configure-wsl-2-for-gpu-workflows.html)

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="amd" label="AMD">

### AMD GPU Support (ROCm Stack)

Install ROCm (Radeon Open Compute):

```bash
sudo apt install rocm-dkms

With these steps, you should be able to develop and run OpenCL applications on most Linux systems with Intel, AMD, NVIDIA GPUs or CPU-only setups.

OpenCL (Open Computing Language) support depends on your hardware and vendor. Choose the appropriate SDK and runtime for your system:

### 🔧 Windows Installation

Download and install the SDK/runtime provided by your hardware vendor:

| **Vendor** | **Download Link**                                                                                  |
|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Intel**  | [Intel OpenCL SDK](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/tool/opencl-drivers.html)       |
| **AMD**    | [AMD OpenCL SDK](https://community.amd.com/t5/general-discussions/insstalling-opencl-ver-1-2-on-womdows-10/m-p/144299/highlight/true)                                     |
| **NVIDIA** | [NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit (includes OpenCL support)](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)      |

> 💡 **Tip:** For NVIDIA devices, OpenCL is installed as part of the CUDA Toolkit.

**Steps:**
1. Download the installer from your vendor’s website.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions or refer to vendor documentation.
3. Set environment variables (like `PATH`, `LIB`, `INCLUDE`) if not set automatically.

---

### 🐧 Linux Installation

Linux systems typically require manual setup. Follow the detailed guide here:

👉 [Steps to Install OpenCL on Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)](#2-how-to-install-opencl-on-linux-ubuntudebian)

> Ensure you install both the ICD loader and the vendor-specific implementation (Intel, AMD, NVIDIA).

---

### 🍏 macOS

OpenCL is **pre-installed** on macOS. However:

- Apple has **deprecated OpenCL** in favor of **Metal** in macOS Mojave and later.
- OpenCL programs may still work, but cross-platform compatibility could be limited.

> ⚠️ For new macOS projects, consider using Metal or building separate OpenCL support for other platforms.

---

## 3 . How to Verify the OpenCL Installation

Run `clinfo` to verify installation:

### Linux/Mac

```bash
clinfo | grep "OpenCL"
```

### Windows

```cmd
clinfo | findstr "OpenCL"
```
:::important
> For windows recommendation is ``WSL``.
:::

If you see platform and device information, your installation is successful.

## 4 . Troubleshooting Common OpenCL Setup Issues

### Platform Not Found

* Double-check driver and SDK installation.
* Ensure your GPU is supported and enabled in BIOS.

### Insufficient Memory

* Check available system and device memory.
* Reduce data size or optimize buffer usage.

### Driver Issues

* Ensure you are using the latest drivers.
* Reinstall drivers if issues persist.
* Check `dmesg` logs (Linux) or Device Manager (Windows).
