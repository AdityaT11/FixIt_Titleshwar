# **Essential C++ Interview Questions on Memory Management**

## **1. What is memory management in C++?**
Memory management in C++ involves handling the allocation and deallocation of memory to optimize performance and avoid memory leaks.

### **Example:**
```cpp
int* ptr = new int(10); // Dynamically allocated memory
std::cout << *ptr << std::endl;
delete ptr; // Free allocated memory
```

### **Sample Answer:**
"Memory management in C++ ensures efficient use of resources by manually allocating and freeing memory using `new` and `delete`."

**When to use:** Dynamic memory management is required when the memory size is not known at compile time.

---

## **2. What are smart pointers in C++?**
Smart pointers in C++ help manage dynamically allocated memory automatically and prevent memory leaks.

### **Example:**
```cpp
#include <memory>
std::unique_ptr<int> uptr = std::make_unique<int>(20);
std::cout << *uptr << std::endl;
```

### **Sample Answer:**
"Smart pointers like `std::unique_ptr` and `std::shared_ptr` automate memory management and prevent leaks."

**When to use:** Use smart pointers instead of raw pointers for better memory safety.

---

## **3. What is a memory leak and how to prevent it?**
A memory leak occurs when dynamically allocated memory is not freed properly, leading to resource exhaustion.

### **Example:**
```cpp
void func() {
    int* ptr = new int(30);
    // Forgetting to delete ptr causes a memory leak
}
```

### **Sample Answer:**
"Memory leaks occur when allocated memory is not deallocated. Using smart pointers or properly managing `new` and `delete` prevents leaks."

**When to use:** Always ensure proper deallocation of memory after use.

---

## **4. What is the difference between stack and heap memory?**
- **Stack Memory**: Managed automatically, stores local variables, and is faster.
- **Heap Memory**: Manually managed using `new` and `delete`, used for dynamic allocation.

### **Example:**
```cpp
int a = 10; // Stack allocation
int* b = new int(20); // Heap allocation
```

### **Sample Answer:**
"Stack memory is automatically managed and faster, while heap memory is manually managed and used for dynamic allocation."

**When to use:** Use stack for temporary variables and heap for dynamic memory allocation.
