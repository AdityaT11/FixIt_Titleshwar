# **Essential C++ Interview Questions on Inheritance and Polymorphism**

## **1. What is inheritance in C++?**
Inheritance is an object-oriented programming concept that allows one class (child/derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors from another class (parent/base class).

### **Example:**
```cpp
class Base {
public:
    void show() { std::cout << "Base class" << std::endl; }
};

class Derived : public Base {
};

int main() {
    Derived d;
    d.show();  // Inherited from Base
    return 0;
}
```

### **Sample Answer:**
"Inheritance allows me to reuse code by extending a base class. It improves code modularity and reduces redundancy."

**When to use:** Use inheritance when you need a hierarchical relationship between classes.

---

## **2. What is polymorphism in C++?**
Polymorphism allows a function or method to have multiple forms. It enables dynamic behavior through method overriding and virtual functions.

### **Example:**
```cpp
class Base {
public:
    virtual void show() { std::cout << "Base class" << std::endl; }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void show() override { std::cout << "Derived class" << std::endl; }
};

int main() {
    Base* b = new Derived();
    b->show();  // Calls Derived class implementation
    delete b;
    return 0;
}
```

### **Sample Answer:**
"Polymorphism allows methods to be overridden, enabling runtime behavior changes. I use virtual functions to achieve it."

**When to use:** Use polymorphism when implementing function overriding and dynamic behavior.

---

## **3. What are virtual functions in C++?**
Virtual functions enable dynamic (runtime) polymorphism by allowing method overriding in derived classes.

### **Example:**
```cpp
class Base {
public:
    virtual void display() { std::cout << "Base display" << std::endl; }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void display() override { std::cout << "Derived display" << std::endl; }
};

int main() {
    Base* obj = new Derived();
    obj->display();  // Calls Derived display
    delete obj;
    return 0;
}
```

### **Sample Answer:**
"A virtual function allows derived classes to override a base class function, enabling runtime polymorphism."

**When to use:** Use virtual functions when dynamic method binding is required.

---

## **4. What is an abstract class in C++?**
An abstract class is a class with at least one pure virtual function. It cannot be instantiated directly.

### **Example:**
```cpp
class Shape {
public:
    virtual void draw() = 0;  // Pure virtual function
};

class Circle : public Shape {
public:
    void draw() override { std::cout << "Drawing Circle" << std::endl; }
};

int main() {
    Shape* s = new Circle();
    s->draw();
    delete s;
    return 0;
}
```

### **Sample Answer:**
"An abstract class in C++ contains at least one pure virtual function and serves as a blueprint for derived classes."

**When to use:** Use abstract classes when you want to define an interface for derived classes.

---

## **5. What is multiple inheritance in C++?**
Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from more than one base class.

### **Example:**
```cpp
class A {
public:
    void showA() { std::cout << "Class A" << std::endl; }
};

class B {
public:
    void showB() { std::cout << "Class B" << std::endl; }
};

class C : public A, public B {
};

int main() {
    C obj;
    obj.showA();
    obj.showB();
    return 0;
}
```

### **Sample Answer:**
"Multiple inheritance enables a class to derive from multiple base classes, but it should be used carefully to avoid ambiguity."

**When to use:** Use multiple inheritance when a class logically needs functionality from multiple sources.

---

## **6. What are the best practices for using inheritance and polymorphism?**

### **Best Practices:**
- Use **public inheritance** when the derived class is a specialized version of the base class.
- Prefer **composition over inheritance** when appropriate.
- Use **virtual destructors** in base classes to avoid memory leaks.
- Avoid **excessive multiple inheritance** to reduce complexity.
- Always use **override** keyword for overriding functions.

### **Sample Answer:**
"I follow best practices such as using virtual destructors, avoiding deep inheritance hierarchies, and preferring composition when possible."

**When to use:** Follow best practices to ensure clean and maintainable object-oriented design.

---

## **7. What is the difference between public, protected, and private inheritance?**

### **Example:**
```cpp
class Base {
public:
    int x;
protected:
    int y;
private:
    int z;
};

class DerivedPublic : public Base { /* x-public, y-protected */ };
class DerivedProtected : protected Base { /* x,y-protected */ };
class DerivedPrivate : private Base { /* x,y-private */ };
```

### **Sample Answer:**
"Public inheritance keeps base members' access the same, protected changes public/protected members to protected, private changes them to private."

**When to use:** Use public inheritance for “is-a” relationships, others to restrict access.

---

## **8. What is constructor inheritance in C++?**

### **Example:**
```cpp
class Base {
public:
    Base(int x) { std::cout << "Base constructor: " << x << std::endl; }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    using Base::Base; // inherit constructors
};

int main() {
    Derived d(5); // calls Base constructor
}
```

###  *Sample Answer:**
"Derived classes can reuse base class constructors using `using Base::Base;`."

**When to use:** Use to simplify derived class construction.

---

## **9. Why should destructors be virtual?**

### **Sample Answer:**
"To ensure proper cleanup of derived objects when deleted via base class pointers."

**When to use:** Always in polymorphic base classes.

---

## **10. What is a pure virtual destructor?**

### **Example:**
```cpp
class Base {
public:
    virtual ~Base() = 0; // pure virtual destructor
};

Base::~Base() { std::cout << "Base destructor\n"; }
```

### **Sample Answer:**
"A pure virtual destructor makes the class abstract but still requires an implementation."

---

## **11. What is object slicing and how to avoid it?**

### **Sample Answer:**
"Assigning a derived object to a base object copies only base part, losing derived data. Avoid by using pointers or references."

---

## **12. What is method overriding?**

### **Sample Answer:**
"Redefining a base class virtual function in a derived class to provide specific behavior."

---

## **13. What is method hiding?**

### **Sample Answer:**
"When a derived class declares a function with the same name but different signature, hiding base class methods."

---

## **14. How does `dynamic_cast` work?**

### **Sample Answer:**
"Performs safe runtime casts between polymorphic types, returning nullptr if cast fails."

---

## **15. Difference between `dynamic_cast` and `static_cast`?**

### **Sample Answer:**
"`dynamic_cast` checks types at runtime; `static_cast` performs unchecked compile-time casts."

---

## **16. What is the diamond problem?**

### **Sample Answer:**
"Ambiguity from multiple inheritance when two base classes inherit the same ancestor."

---

## **17. How to solve the diamond problem?**

### **Sample Answer:**
"Use virtual inheritance to share a single base class instance."

---

## **18. What is virtual inheritance?**

### **Sample Answer:**
"Ensures only one copy of the base class exists when inherited multiple times."

---

## **19. Can constructors be virtual?**

### **Sample Answer:**
"No, constructors cannot be virtual."

---

## **20. What is the role of the `override` keyword?**

### **Sample Answer:**
"Ensures the method overrides a base virtual function and helps catch errors."

---

## **21. How do you call a base class method from a derived class?**

### **Example:**
```cpp
void Derived::show() {
    Base::show();
}
```

---

## **22. What is covariant return type?**

### **Sample Answer:**
"Derived classes can override virtual functions to return pointers or references to derived types."

---

## **23. What is the difference between early binding and late binding?**

### **Sample Answer:**
"Early binding happens at compile-time for non-virtual functions; late binding happens at runtime for virtual functions."

---

## **24. What is a virtual table (vtable)?**

### **Sample Answer:**

"A mechanism used by C++ to support dynamic dispatch of virtual functions."

---

## **25. Can virtual functions be private?**

### **Sample Answer:**
"Yes, virtual functions can be private or protected."

---

## **26. What happens if base class destructor is not virtual?**

### **Sample Answer:**
"Deleting derived class objects via base pointers leads to undefined behavior."

---

## **27. How does polymorphism improve code flexibility?**

### **Sample Answer:**
"Allows working with base pointers/references while executing derived class methods."

---

## **28. What is interface inheritance?**

### **Sample Answer:**
"Inheriting pure virtual functions only, defining an interface."

---

## **29. What is implementation inheritance?**

### **Sample Answer:**
"Inheriting concrete implementations (methods and data)."

---

## **30. What are the access specifiers in inheritance?**

### **Sample Answer:**
"`public`, `protected`, and `private` control access to base class members in derived classes."

---

## **31. How can multiple inheritance cause ambiguity?**

### **Sample Answer:**
"If two base classes have a method with the same name, calls become ambiguous."

---

## **32. How to resolve ambiguity from multiple inheritance?**

### **Sample Answer:**
"Use scope resolution or virtual inheritance."

---

## **33. Can you inherit from a final class?**

### **Sample Answer:**
"No, `final` classes cannot be derived."

---

## **34. Why prefer composition over inheritance?**

### **Sample Answer:**
"Composition offers better flexibility and avoids tight coupling."

---

## **35. What is runtime polymorphism in C++?**

### **Example:**
```cpp
class Animal {
public:
    virtual void speak() { std::cout << "Animal speaks\n"; }
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void speak() override { std::cout << "Dog barks\n"; }
};

int main() {
    Animal* a = new Dog();
    a->speak();  // Outputs: Dog barks
    delete a;
}
```

### **Sample Answer:**
"Runtime polymorphism uses virtual functions to determine the method call at runtime based on the object type."

**When to use:** Use when you want behavior to vary depending on the derived object type at runtime.

---

## **36. What is compile-time polymorphism in C++?**

### **Example:**
```cpp
class Calculator {
public:
    int add(int a, int b) { return a + b; }
    double add(double a, double b) { return a + b; }
};
```

### **Sample Answer:**
"Compile-time polymorphism is achieved through function overloading or operator overloading."

**When to use:** Use when operations share a name but differ by parameter type or number.

---

## **37. Can polymorphism be achieved without inheritance?**

### **Sample Answer:**
"Compile-time polymorphism (like function overloading or templates) can be used without inheritance, but runtime polymorphism requires inheritance and virtual functions."

**When to use:** Use non-inheritance polymorphism when behavior can be resolved at compile-time.

---

## **38. How does polymorphism support open/closed principle?**

### **Sample Answer:**
"Polymorphism allows adding new behavior via derived classes without changing existing base class code."

**When to use:** Use when designing systems meant to be extended without modifying stable code.

---

## **39. What is the difference between polymorphism and inheritance?**

### **Sample Answer:**
"Inheritance enables reuse of code; polymorphism enables dynamic behavior. Inheritance is a prerequisite for runtime polymorphism."

**When to use:** Use inheritance for structure, and polymorphism for behavior variation.

---

## **40. Can templates be used with polymorphism?**

### **Example:**
```cpp
template<typename T>
void printType(const T& obj) {
    obj.show();
}
```

### **Sample Answer:**
"Templates provide compile-time polymorphism. They allow the same function to work with different types."

**When to use:** Use templates when behavior is known at compile-time and doesn’t require runtime dispatch.
