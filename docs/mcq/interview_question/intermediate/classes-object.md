  This guide focuses on essential C++ interview questions about classes and objects â€” the fundamental building blocks of object-oriented programming. Learn how classes encapsulate data and behavior, how to create and manipulate objects, and understand key concepts like member functions, access specifiers, constructors, destructors, and more. Prepare for interviews by mastering class design, object instantiation, and object-oriented principles in C++.

# **Essential C++ Interview Questions on Classes and Objects**

## **1. What is a class in C++?**

A **class** is a user-defined data type that serves as a blueprint for creating objects. It encapsulates data and methods into a single entity.

### **Syntax:**

```cpp
class ClassName {
public:
    int data;
    void display() {
        std::cout << "Data: " << data << std::endl;
    }
};
```

### **Example:**

```cpp
class Car {
public:
    std::string brand;
    int year;
    
    void showInfo() {
        std::cout << "Brand: " << brand << ", Year: " << year << std::endl;
    }
};
```

### **Sample Answer:**

"A class is a template for creating objects. It allows me to encapsulate data (variables) and behaviors (methods) into a single unit."

**When to use:** Use classes when implementing real-world entities with attributes and behaviors.

---

## **2. What is an object in C++?**

An **object** is an instance of a class that holds its own copy of the class attributes.

### **Example:**

```cpp
Car myCar;
myCar.brand = "Toyota";
myCar.year = 2022;
myCar.showInfo();
```

### **Sample Answer:**

"An object is a concrete entity based on a class. It represents an instance with specific values assigned to its attributes."

**When to use:** Use objects to create multiple instances of a class with different data.

---

## **3. What is encapsulation in C++?**

Encapsulation is an **OOP principle** that restricts direct access to object data and allows controlled access through methods.

### **Example:**

```cpp
class BankAccount {
private:
    double balance;

public:
    void deposit(double amount) {
        balance += amount;
    }

    double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }
};
```

### **Sample Answer:**

"Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods to restrict direct access. I use access modifiers (`private`, `public`) to control access."

**When to use:** Use encapsulation to protect sensitive data.
