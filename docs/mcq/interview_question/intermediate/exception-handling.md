# **Essential C++ Interview Questions on Exception Handling**

## **1. What is exception handling in C++?**
Exception handling is a mechanism in C++ to handle runtime errors gracefully using `try`, `catch`, and `throw` keywords.

### **Example:**
```cpp
try {
    int a = 10, b = 0;
    if (b == 0) throw "Division by zero error!";
    int result = a / b;
} catch (const char* msg) {
    std::cerr << msg << std::endl;
}
```

### **Sample Answer:**
"Exception handling in C++ allows me to handle errors without crashing the program using `try`, `catch`, and `throw`."

**When to use:** Use exception handling when dealing with runtime errors such as division by zero, invalid memory access, and file handling errors.

---

## **2. What are standard exceptions in C++?**
C++ provides a set of standard exceptions derived from the `std::exception` class.

### **Example:**
```cpp
try {
    throw std::runtime_error("Runtime error occurred");
} catch (const std::exception& e) {
    std::cout << "Exception: " << e.what() << std::endl;
}
```

### **Sample Answer:**
"C++ has built-in exceptions like `std::runtime_error`, `std::logic_error`, and `std::bad_alloc`. I use them for handling common errors effectively."

**When to use:** Use standard exceptions for common errors like memory allocation failure or logical errors.

---

## **3. How do you create a custom exception in C++?**

### **Example:**
```cpp
class MyException : public std::exception {
public:
    const char* what() const noexcept override {
        return "Custom exception occurred";
    }
};

try {
    throw MyException();
} catch (const MyException& e) {
    std::cout << e.what() << std::endl;
}
```

### **Sample Answer:**
"A custom exception in C++ is created by inheriting from `std::exception` and overriding the `what()` function."

**When to use:** Use custom exceptions for specific application errors.

---

## **4. What is exception safety and best practices?**

### **Best Practices:**
- Use `try-catch` only where necessary.
- Prefer RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) for resource management.
- Catch exceptions by reference (`const std::exception&`).
- Use `noexcept` where applicable to avoid unnecessary exception checks.

### **Sample Answer:**
"Exception safety ensures that code behaves correctly even when exceptions occur. I follow best practices like using RAII and avoiding raw pointers."

**When to use:** Use exception safety principles to write robust and maintainable C++ code.

---

## **5. What is the role of `try` block in exception handling?**

### **Example:**
```cpp
try {
    int x = 5;
    if (x == 5) throw std::runtime_error("Error: x cannot be 5");
}
```

### **Sample Answer:**
"The `try` block contains code that might throw exceptions. It lets me test code and handle any exceptions that occur."

**When to use:** Use `try` around code segments where exceptions might happen.

---

## **6. What is the role of `catch` block?**

### **Example:**
```cpp
try {
    throw std::string("Error occurred");
} catch (const std::string& e) {
    std::cout << "Caught exception: " << e << std::endl;
}
```

### **Sample Answer:**
"The `catch` block handles exceptions thrown in the `try` block, allowing graceful error recovery."

**When to use:** Use `catch` to handle specific exceptions after a `try` block.

---

## **7. What does the `throw` keyword do?**

### **Example:**
```cpp
if (value < 0) throw std::invalid_argument("Negative value not allowed");
```

### **Sample Answer:**
"`throw` signals that an error has occurred by raising an exception."

**When to use:** Use `throw` to signal an error condition or exceptional event.

---

## **8. What happens if an exception is not caught?**

### **Sample Answer:**
"If an exception is not caught, the program calls `std::terminate` and usually crashes."

**When to use:** Always catch exceptions or ensure they propagate to a safe handler.

---

## **9. Can you catch multiple exceptions? How?**

### **Example:**
```cpp
try {
    // code
} catch (const std::out_of_range& e) {
    std::cout << "Out of range error\n";
} catch (const std::invalid_argument& e) {
    std::cout << "Invalid argument error\n";
}
```

### **Sample Answer:**
"I can have multiple `catch` blocks to handle different exception types separately."

**When to use:** Use multiple catches for specific handling of different errors.

---

## **10. What is a catch-all handler?**

### **Example:**
```cpp
try {
    // code
} catch (...) {
    std::cout << "Unknown exception caught\n";
}
```

### **Sample Answer:**
"A catch-all handler `catch(...)` catches any exception not caught by earlier catch blocks."

**When to use:** Use it as a safety net for unknown exceptions.

---

## **11. How does stack unwinding work during exceptions?**

### **Sample Answer:**
"Stack unwinding destroys local objects as the exception propagates, ensuring proper cleanup."

**When to use:** Understand this when managing resources manually during exceptions.

---

## **12. What is RAII and how does it relate to exception handling?**

### **Sample Answer:**
"RAII ties resource lifetimes to object lifetimes, ensuring automatic cleanup during stack unwinding."

**When to use:** Use RAII to manage resources safely with exceptions.

---

## **13. What is the difference between `throw` and `throw;`?**

### **Sample Answer:**
"`throw` raises a new exception, while `throw;` rethrows the current exception inside a catch block."

**When to use:** Use `throw;` to propagate exceptions further.

---

## **14. Can you catch exceptions by value, pointer, or reference? Which is preferred?**

### **Sample Answer:**
"Catching by `const reference` is preferred to avoid slicing and copying."

**When to use:** Always catch exceptions as `const T&`.

---

## **15. What is `std::exception`?**

### **Sample Answer:**
"`std::exception` is the base class for all standard C++ exceptions."

**When to use:** Catch `const std::exception&` to handle all standard exceptions.

---

## **16. Can you catch exceptions of different types using a single catch block?**

### **Sample Answer:**
"No, each catch handles one exception type, but you can catch by a base class."

**When to use:** Catch by a common base class to handle multiple exception types.

---

## **17. What is `noexcept` and when should it be used?**

### **Example:**
```cpp
void foo() noexcept {
    // This function promises not to throw exceptions
}
```

### **Sample Answer:**
"`noexcept` indicates a function does not throw exceptions, helping optimization and program safety."

**When to use:** Use `noexcept` on functions that won't throw.

---

## **18. Can constructors throw exceptions?**

### **Sample Answer:**
"Yes, constructors can throw exceptions if initialization fails."

**When to use:** Be cautious and use RAII to manage resources during construction.

---

## **19. How to handle exceptions in destructors?**

### **Sample Answer:**
"Destructors should not throw exceptions; if they do, it can cause `std::terminate`."

**When to use:** Catch and handle exceptions inside destructors.

---

## **20. What is stack unwinding?**

### **Sample Answer:**
"Stack unwinding is the process of calling destructors for all local objects as an exception propagates."

**When to use:** Understand for resource cleanup during exceptions.

---

## **21. What happens if an exception is thrown during stack unwinding?**

### **Sample Answer:**
"If an exception is thrown during stack unwinding, the program terminates."

**When to use:** Avoid throwing exceptions in destructors.

---

## **22. Can exceptions cross shared library boundaries?**

### **Sample Answer:**
"It depends on compiler and ABI; generally yes but with caution."

**When to use:** Be careful with exceptions in mixed binary environments.

---

## **23. What is `std::bad_alloc`?**

### **Sample Answer:**
"`std::bad_alloc` is thrown when `new` fails to allocate memory."

**When to use:** Handle memory allocation failures.

---

## **24. How do you disable exceptions globally?**

### **Sample Answer:**
"By compiling with `-fno-exceptions` (in GCC), but it's not recommended."

**When to use:** Only in embedded or performance-critical systems.

---

## **25. What is the difference between checked and unchecked exceptions?**

### **Sample Answer:**
"C++ only has unchecked exceptions; no enforced compile-time checking."

**When to use:** Understand difference from other languages like Java.

---

## **26. Can you catch exceptions thrown from within a `noexcept` function?**

### **Sample Answer:**
"No; if a `noexcept` function throws, `std::terminate` is called."

**When to use:** Ensure `noexcept` functions do not throw.

---

## **27. What is the purpose of `std::terminate()`?**

### **Sample Answer:**
"It is called when an exception is not caught or thrown during stack unwinding."

**When to use:** Understand as the program’s abrupt exit point.

---

## **28. How to rethrow an exception?**

### **Example:**
```cpp
catch (const std::exception& e) {
    std::cout << "Handling exception\n";
    throw;  // Rethrow the current exception
}
```

### **Sample Answer:**
"Use `throw;` inside a catch block to rethrow the current exception."

---

## **29. What is `std::exception_ptr`?**

### **Sample Answer:**
"`std::exception_ptr` stores and propagates exceptions safely between threads."

**When to use:** Use for advanced multithreading exception handling.

---

## **30. How can exceptions be used with multithreading?**

### **Sample Answer:**
"Exceptions can be caught in threads and passed via `std::exception_ptr` to other threads."

---

## **31. Can exception handling affect program performance?**

### **Sample Answer:**
"Yes, especially if exceptions are thrown frequently; use for exceptional cases only."

---

## **32. What is the difference between `throw` and `return` for error handling?**

### **Sample Answer:**
"`throw` transfers control via exceptions, while `return` requires manual checks."

---

## **33. What are the disadvantages of exception handling?**

### **Sample Answer:**
"Overuse can lead to complex code; some platforms have limited support."

---

## **34. What is an exception specification?**

### **Sample Answer:**
"Old C++ had exception specifications like `throw(int)`, but deprecated now."

---

## **35. How to define a noexcept function that might conditionally throw?**

### **Example:**
```cpp
void f() noexcept(false) { /* may throw */ }
```

---

## **36. What happens if `main()` throws an exception?**

### **Sample Answer:**
"If not caught, program calls `std::terminate`."

---

## **37. How to handle exceptions in templates?**

### **Sample Answer:**
"Templates can throw exceptions like normal functions."

---

## **38. What is the effect of catching exceptions by non-const reference?**

### **Sample Answer:**
"Possible to modify exception object; generally not recommended."

---

## **39. How do you log exceptions in C++?**

### **Sample Answer:**
"Inside catch blocks, log exception details using `e.what()` or custom messages."

---

## **40. What is the use of `std::unexpected()`?**

### **Sample Answer:**
"Called if an exception not allowed by exception specification is thrown (deprecated)."
