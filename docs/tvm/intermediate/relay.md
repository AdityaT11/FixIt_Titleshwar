title: Relay in TVM
description: |
  Relay is an intermediate representation (IR) in TVM, designed to bridge the gap between high-level deep learning models and low-level hardware-specific code. This guide explores how Relay works in TVM, its role in optimization, and how it enables advanced optimizations like operator fusion, graph rewriting, and target-specific code generation. Learn how to leverage Relay for efficient model optimization and deployment across different hardware backends.
