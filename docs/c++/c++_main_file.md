- Function overloading
- Recursion basics

### 5. Arrays and Strings

- One-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays
- C-style strings and character arrays
- Basic string operations

### 6. Pointers Basics

- Pointer declaration and initialization
- Pointer arithmetic
- Relationship between pointers and arrays

### 7. Basic Memory Management

- Stack vs heap memory
- Dynamic memory allocation using `new` and `delete`
- Understanding memory leaks

- Memory debugging tools and practices

### 5. Standard Template Library (STL) - Part 1

- Sequence containers: `vector`, `list`, `deque`
- Associative containers: `set`, `map`
- Container adapters: `stack`, `queue`, `priority_queue`

### 6. Exception Handling

- `try`, `catch`, and `throw`
- Standard exceptions
- Creating custom exception classes
