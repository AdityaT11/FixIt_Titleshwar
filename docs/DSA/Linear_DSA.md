## Introduction

**Linear Data Structures (LDS)** are foundational concepts in computer science where data elements are arranged sequentially. This sequential nature makes them intuitive and easy to implement, forming the base for more complex structures.

They allow for efficient access and modification of data, especially when operations are performed in order.

<div>
    <AdBanner />
</div>

## What are Linear Data Structures?

A **linear data structure** organizes data elements in a **sequential manner**. Each element is connected to its previous and next element, making traversal straightforward (like moving through a list).

In contrast to non-linear structures (trees, graphs), linear structures have a **single level** of data organization.

Examples include:

* Arrays
* Linked Lists
* Stacks
* Queues

## Types of Linear Data Structures

### 1. Arrays

An **array** is a linear data structure that stores a **fixed-size sequence of elements** of the same data type in **contiguous memory**. Each element can be quickly accessed using its **index**, making arrays highly efficient for read operations.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="C++" label="C++">
```cpp
int arr[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Java" label="Java">
```javascript
int[] arr = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Python" label="Python">
```python
arr = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

In this array:

* `arr[0]` holds `10`
* `arr[1]` holds `20`
* ...
* `arr[4]` holds `50`

<div>
    <AdBanner />
</div>

#### üîß Characteristics

* **Contiguous Memory Allocation**: All elements are stored next to each other in memory.
* **Zero-Based Indexing**: Most programming languages index arrays starting from 0.
* **Static Size**: The array size must be defined upfront and cannot be resized later.
* **Homogeneous Data Type**: All elements must be of the same type (e.g., all integers).

<div>
    <AdBanner />
</div>

#### Advantages

* **Fast Access (`O(1)`)**: Accessing any element by index is instantaneous.
* **Simplicity**: Easy to declare and use in any programming language.
* **Cache Efficiency**: Contiguous layout optimizes cache performance in loops.

<div>
    <AdBanner />
</div>

#### Disadvantages

* **Fixed Capacity**: Cannot shrink or grow dynamically.
* **Insertion/Deletion is Costly**: Requires shifting elements (`O(n)`).
* **Memory Waste**: Declaring larger-than-needed arrays may result in wasted space.

<div>
    <AdBanner />
</div>

####  Use Cases

* Storing collections of items with known size.
* Implementing basic sorting/searching algorithms.
* Representing matrices or fixed-size buffers.

:::caution When to use Array
### üí° Tip: When to Use an Array

> Use an array when you:
>
> - Need to store **multiple items** of the **same data type**
> - Know the **number of elements** in advance or don't need to frequently change it
> - Require **fast access by index** (O(1) time complexity)
> - Want **contiguous memory allocation** for better cache performance
>
> ‚ùó If you need **dynamic resizing**, consider using a `Vector` in C++ or a `List` in Python/Java instead.
:::

### 2. Linked Lists

A **linked list** is a linear data structure made up of **nodes**, where each node contains two parts: the **data** and a **pointer** (or reference) to the next node in the sequence.


<Tabs>
<TabItem label="C++" value="C++">

```cpp
struct Node {
  int data;
  Node* next;
};
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Java" value="Java">

```javascript
class Node {
  int data;
  Node next;
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Python" value="Python">

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>



Unlike arrays, linked lists do not store elements in contiguous memory. Instead, each element points to the next, allowing for dynamic memory allocation and easier insertion/deletion.


#### üîÑ Types of Linked Lists

* **Singly Linked List**: Each node points to the next node only.
* **Doubly Linked List**: Each node points to both the next and previous nodes.
* **Circular Linked List**: The last node points back to the head, forming a circle.



#### Advantages

* **Dynamic Size**: Can grow or shrink during execution.
* **Efficient Insert/Delete**: Insertion and deletion at the head/tail are `O(1)` operations.
* **Memory Efficient**: Allocates memory as needed.



#### Disadvantages

* **Sequential Access**: Elements must be accessed one-by-one (`O(n)`), no direct indexing.
* **Extra Memory Overhead**: Requires additional memory for pointers.
* **More Complex Operations**: Implementation and traversal are more complex than arrays.



#### Use Cases

* Building dynamic data structures like stacks, queues, and hash tables.
* Implementing memory management systems.
* Handling dynamic datasets where insert/delete operations are frequent.

### üí° Tip: When to Use a Linked List

> Use a linked list when you:
>
> - Need **frequent insertions or deletions** in the middle or beginning of the list
> - Don‚Äôt know the total number of elements in advance
> - Want to avoid the **overhead of resizing**, as with arrays or vectors
> - Are okay with **sequential access** (no random access like arrays)
>
> ‚ùó If you need **fast index-based access**, a linked list is not ideal. Use an array or vector instead.

:::
### 3. Stacks

A **Stack** is a linear data structure that follows the **LIFO (Last In First Out)** principle. In this structure, the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. Think of it like a stack of plates: you add plates to the top and also remove them from the top.



#### Key Operations

1. **push(x)**: Adds the element `x` to the top of the stack.
2. **pop()**: Removes the element from the top of the stack.
3. **top()** or **peek()**: Returns the topmost element without removing it.
4. **empty()**: Checks whether the stack is empty.
5. **size()**: Returns the number of elements in the stack.

<div>
    <AdBanner />
</div>

#### Use Cases of Stacks

* **Undo Mechanism**: In text editors and applications, every action can be pushed onto a stack. When "undo" is pressed, the last action is popped off.
* **Syntax Parsing**: Compilers use stacks to validate expressions, such as checking for balanced parentheses.
* **Function Calls**: During recursion or nested function calls, the system uses a call stack to manage return addresses.
* **Expression Evaluation**: Stacks help in evaluating postfix or prefix expressions.

<div>
    <AdBanner />
</div>

#### Stack Examples in Different Languages

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="cpp" label="C++" default>

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    stack<int> s;
    s.push(10);  // Push element onto the stack
    s.push(20);
    cout << "Top element: " << s.top() << endl;  // Should print 20
    s.pop();     // Removes the top element
    cout << "Top after pop: " << s.top() << endl;  // Should print 10
    return 0;
}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```javascript
import java.util.Stack;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Stack<Integer> s = new Stack<>();
        s.push(10);  // Push element onto the stack
        s.push(20);
        System.out.println("Top element: " + s.peek()); // Should print 20
        s.pop();     // Removes the top element
        System.out.println("Top after pop: " + s.peek()); // Should print 10
    }
}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python
stack = []
stack.append(10)  # Push element onto the stack
stack.append(20)
print("Top element:", stack[-1])  # Should print 20
stack.pop()  # Removes the top element
print("Top after pop:", stack[-1])  # Should print 10
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Stacks are a fundamental concept in computer science, and understanding their behavior is essential for solving problems involving nested structures, backtracking, and function management.

 ### üí° Tip: When to Use a Stack

> Use a stack when you:
>
> - Need to process elements in **Last In, First Out (LIFO)** order
> - Are implementing **undo functionality**, **backtracking**, or **recursive algorithms**
> - Want to manage **function calls or expression evaluation**
> - Need a simple way to **store intermediate states**
>
> ‚ùó If you need to access elements from both ends or randomly, a stack is not the right choice. Consider using a deque or another data structure.

 :::

### 4. Queues

A **Queue** is a linear data structure that follows the **FIFO (First In First Out)** principle. In this structure, the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed. Think of it like a line at a ticket counter: the person who arrives first gets served first.

---

#### Key Operations

1. **enqueue(x)**: Adds the element `x` to the rear of the queue.
2. **dequeue()**: Removes the element from the front of the queue.
3. **front()** or **peek()**: Returns the front element without removing it.
4. **empty()**: Checks whether the queue is empty.
5. **size()**: Returns the number of elements in the queue.

---

#### Variants of Queues

* **Circular Queue**: A queue in which the last position is connected back to the first position to make a circle.
* **Priority Queue**: A queue where elements are removed based on priority rather than arrival order.
* **Deque (Double-ended Queue)**: A queue in which insertion and deletion can occur from both ends.

---

#### Use Cases of Queues

* **CPU Scheduling**: Tasks are scheduled based on their arrival time.
* **Task Queues**: Used in messaging systems and real-time data processing.

#### Queue Examples in Different Languages

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="C++" label="C++">

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    queue<int> q;
    q.push(1);  // Enqueue element
    q.push(2);
    cout << "Front element: " << q.front() << endl;  // Should print 1
    q.pop();  // Dequeue element
    cout << "Front after pop: " << q.front() << endl;  // Should print 2
    return 0;
}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Java" label="Java">

```javascript
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.Queue;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Queue<Integer> q = new LinkedList<>();
        q.add(1);  // Enqueue element
        q.add(2);
        System.out.println("Front element: " + q.peek()); // Should print 1
        q.remove();  // Dequeue element
        System.out.println("Front after dequeue: " + q.peek()); // Should print 2
    }
}
```

q = deque()
q.append(1)  # Enqueue element
q.append(2)
print("Front element:", q[0])  # Should print 1
q.popleft()  # Dequeue element
print("Front after pop:", q[0])  # Should print 2
```

### üí° Tip: When to Use a Queue

> Use a queue when you:
>
> - Need to process elements in **First In, First Out (FIFO)** order
> - Are handling **tasks, events, or requests** in the order they arrive
> - Need to implement **breadth-first search (BFS)** or **job scheduling**
> - Want a structure for **buffering** (e.g., in data streams or printers)
>
> ‚ùó If you need to insert or remove elements from both ends, consider using a deque instead of a standard queue.
