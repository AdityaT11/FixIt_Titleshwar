graph TD;
    A[Input Size] -->|Increasing| B[Time Complexity];
    B --> C[Best Case];
    B --> D[Average Case];
    B --> E[Worst Case];
```

## 2. Graph Theory
Graphs model real-world networks such as social networks, road maps, and communication networks.

### Real-Life Example in Technology
- **Google Maps**: Uses graph theory to find the shortest path between locations.
- **Social Media**: Platforms like Facebook and LinkedIn represent users as nodes and connections as edges.

### Diagram Representation
```mermaid
graph LR;
    A[User A] --> B[User B];
    A --> C[User C];
    B --> D[User D];
```

## 3. Probability & Combinatorics
Probability and combinatorics help in randomized algorithms, cryptography, and AI decision-making.

### Real-Life Example in Technology
- **Spam Filters**: Email services use probabilistic models to detect spam.
- **AI & ML**: Bayesian networks are used in recommendation systems like Netflix and Amazon.

### Diagram Representation
```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Spam Email] -->|Probability| B[Detected as Spam];
    A -->|Low Probability| C[Not Spam];
```

## 4. Recurrence Relations
Recurrence relations define recursive functions and divide & conquer algorithms.

### Real-Life Example in Technology
- **Merge Sort**: Breaks down a list into smaller sublists and recursively sorts them.
- **Fibonacci Sequence**: Used in financial modeling and computer algorithms.

### Diagram Representation
```mermaid
