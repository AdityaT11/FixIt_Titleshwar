## What is Bash?

**Bash** stands for **Bourne Again SHell** and is a Unix shell and command language written as a free software replacement for the Bourne shell (`sh`). It is widely used on Linux and macOS systems as the default login shell.

Bash provides a command-line interface (CLI) for users to interact with the operating system. It's not just for executing individual commands ‚Äî Bash also supports programming constructs like **variables**, **conditionals**, **loops**, and **functions**, which allows users to write scripts that automate tasks.

Bash can be used interactively (typing commands one by one) or non-interactively (running a script). It reads commands from the standard input or from a script file and executes them line by line.

### Bash System Overview ‚Äì Diagram Explanation

The diagram above shows how a command flows through the Linux system using the Bash shell.

<div>

<div>

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **User**
   - The user types a command (e.g., `ls`, `echo "Hello"`, `pwd`) into the terminal.

2. **Bash Shell**
   - Bash is the default shell in most Linux systems.
   - It parses the command, resolves variables (if any), and checks for syntax.
   - Then it sends a request to the **Linux kernel** using system calls.

3. **Linux Kernel**
   - The kernel is the core part of the OS that handles resource management, process scheduling, and hardware communication.
   - It receives the system call from Bash and takes the necessary action (e.g., accessing files, listing directories).

4. **Hardware**
   - The kernel interacts with the hardware (disk, memory, CPU, etc.) to perform the requested operation.

5. **Back to Kernel ‚Üí Bash ‚Üí User**
   - The result of the operation is passed back from the hardware to the kernel, then to Bash, which displays the output to the user in the terminal.

## What is a Shell?

A **Shell** is a command-line interface that allows users to interact with the operating system by typing commands. It serves as an intermediary between the user and the kernel (core of the OS). The shell interprets the commands given by the user into actions that the kernel can perform, such as running programs, managing files, and executing scripts. Shells like **Bash**, **Zsh**, and **PowerShell** also support scripting to automate repetitive tasks.

### Detailed Explanation of Shell Diagram

- **User**  
  This is you‚Äîthe person sitting at the computer. You want the computer to do something, like show files, run a program, or open a document. But the computer doesn‚Äôt understand plain English or human language. It understands commands, and you give those commands through the **shell**.

- **Shell (CLI Interpreter)**  
  The shell is like a helpful assistant or translator. You type in a command like `ls` to list files or `cd` to change folders. The shell understands what you're asking for and converts it into a form that the deeper part of the computer (the kernel) can act on. Shells also allow you to write small programs (called shell scripts) to automate tasks like backups or data processing.

- **Operating System Kernel**  
  The kernel is the core part of the operating system‚Äîit‚Äôs the boss. It receives the translated instructions from the shell and decides how to carry them out. For example, if you want to open a file, the kernel finds it on the hard disk and loads it into memory. It also controls things like how memory is used, how files are stored, and how programs run. You never interact directly with the kernel‚Äîit always works behind the scenes.

- **System Hardware**  
  These are the actual physical parts of the computer: the CPU (brain), RAM (memory), hard drives (storage), graphics card, and so on. The kernel tells the hardware what to do‚Äîlike displaying text on your monitor, reading from the hard drive, or sending data to a printer.

### Real-Life Example

Imagine you're ordering food at a restaurant:

1. **User**: You're the customer placing an order.
2. **Shell**: The waiter who takes your order and explains it to the chef.
3. **Kernel**: The chef who understands how to prepare the food based on the request.
4. **Hardware**: The kitchen appliances and tools used to cook and serve the food.



### Step-by-Step Flow

1. **You type a command** like `mkdir new_folder` to make a new folder.
2. The **shell reads it**, understands it means ‚Äúmake a new directory,‚Äù and tells the kernel.
3. The **kernel processes the request**, asking the file system and memory to create space for a new folder.
4. The **hardware (like your hard drive)** is used to physically store that folder.
5. The result is shown on your screen, usually with no error if it worked.



This system keeps things organized, secure, and efficient, letting users control a powerful machine with just a few words.

## What is a Bash Script?

A **Bash script** is a plain text file that contains a series of commands written for the **Bash shell** to execute. These scripts automate tasks by running multiple shell commands in sequence, reducing the need for manual input.

Bash scripts are commonly used in Linux and Unix systems for:

- Automating repetitive tasks (like backups or installations)
- Running system administration jobs
- Creating deployment pipelines
- Simplifying command-line workflows

A typical Bash script starts with a **shebang** (`#!`) to indicate the interpreter:


```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, this is a Bash script!"
```

## Why Use Bash Scripts?

``Bash scripts`` are powerful tools used in ``Unix-like`` operating systems ``(Linux, macOS, etc.)`` to automate and streamline ``command-line`` tasks. Instead of manually entering a sequence of commands every time, you can save them in a file and execute them together.

<details>
<summary> Know the Reason</summary>

Here are key reasons why Bash scripts are widely used:

:::caution Reason to Use bash
### 1. üõ† Automation
Bash scripts help automate repetitive tasks, reducing manual effort and human error. Tasks like backups, log rotation, system updates, or file transfers can be scripted once and run anytime.

### 2. üîÅ Reusability
Scripts can be reused and shared across different systems or users. Once written, they can be executed multiple times without changes, ensuring consistency.

### 3. Simplified Workflow
Multiple complex terminal commands can be combined into a single, executable `.sh` file. This reduces cognitive load and improves productivity.

### 4. üë®‚Äçüíª System Administration
System administrators use Bash scripts to manage users, configure environments, install packages, check system status, and automate scheduled tasks using cron.

### 5. üß∞ Custom Tool Creation
You can build lightweight tools for your daily use ‚Äî such as file converters, monitoring scripts, or launchers ‚Äî using just Bash and built-in commands.

### 6. Scheduling with Cron Jobs
Bash scripts can be scheduled using `cron` to run at specific times or intervals (daily, hourly, etc.), enabling unattended operations like backups or report generation.

### 7. ‚öôÔ∏è Integration with Linux Ecosystem
Bash scripts work seamlessly with other command-line tools (like `grep`, `awk`, `sed`, `curl`, etc.), making them extremely versatile.

### 8. Performance & Portability
Since Bash is pre-installed on most Linux systems, Bash scripts don‚Äôt require external dependencies and execute quickly.

## Getting Started: Writing Your First Bash Script

Bash scripting is a powerful way to automate tasks on Unix-like systems. Let's walk through how to write and run your first Bash script.

## The Shebang (`#!/bin/bash`)

The **shebang** is the first line of every Bash script. It tells the system which interpreter to use to run the script.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
```

* `#!` is a special character sequence called the **shebang**.
* `/bin/bash` is the path to the **Bash** shell interpreter.

### Example:

Create a new file called `hello.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, world!"
```

This script will simply print "Hello, world!" to the terminal.


<div>
<AdBanner />
<div>
## Making a Script Executable

After writing the script, you need to make it executable to run it directly.

### Step-by-Step:

1. Save your script, e.g., `hello.sh`.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the file.
3. Run the following command to make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x hello.sh
```

4. Now run the script with:

```bash
./hello.sh
```

You should see the output:

```
Hello, world!
```



Congratulations! You've just written and executed your first Bash script!
